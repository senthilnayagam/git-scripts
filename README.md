git-scripts
===========

git scripts I use/wrote for my daily work



when give access to a existing project with many branches

project overview

total commits

total files

top committers

first commit

last commit

./git_project_stats.sh



I want to know which branch are active

./git-branches-with-latest-commits.sh

track all the branches locally

./git-fetch-all-remote-branches.sh







identify large commits, as a single line as it helps with subsequent processing 

./git-shortstat-singleline.sh




sort files by lines of code, ignoring binary files
./git-list-files-by-lines.sh


keyword statistics for a file extension
./git-keywords-stats.sh *.rb
